# Project:
# Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction<br>
### Description: 
The dataset used for predictive modelling was generated by the Wild 
Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, which is an open-source, spatiallyexplicit computer simulation program, that enables exploration of how various 
factors, including plant spatial arrangement, outcrossing and self-pollination, 
bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and 
combination, affect pollination eficiency and yield of the wild blueberry agroecosystem. The simulation model has been validated by the field observation 
and experimental data collected in Maine USA and Canadian Maritimes during 
the last 30 years and now is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory 
development for wild blueberry pollination researches. This simulated data 
provides researchers who have actual data collected from field observation and 
those who wants to experiment the potential of machine learning algorithms 
response to real data and computer simulation modelling generated data as 
input for crop yield prediction models. 
The dataset and Research paper are provided into the drive …<br>
Problem Statement:
The target feature is yieldwhich is a continuous variable. The task is to 
classify this variable based on the other 17 features step-by-step by going 
through each day's task. The evaluation metrics will be RMSE score<br>
# What is IQR?<br>
Wikipedia Definition<br>

The interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread or middle 50%, or technically H-spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 − Q1<br>
